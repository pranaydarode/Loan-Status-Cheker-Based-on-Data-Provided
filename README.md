Loan Status Predictive System
!Loan

Overview:
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting loan approval status based on historical loan data. Whether you‚Äôre a financial analyst, a data scientist, or simply curious about loan approval processes, this project provides valuable insights.

Features:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Load historical loan data from ‚Äòloans.csv‚Äô, examine its structure, handle duplicate rows, and preprocess features.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, etc.
Model Training: Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify loan applications as approved or rejected.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model‚Äôs performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualize the confusion matrix.
Deployment (Optional): If applicable, deploy the model for real-time loan status predictions.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project includes labeled loan applications (approved or rejected). You can find it in the data directory.
